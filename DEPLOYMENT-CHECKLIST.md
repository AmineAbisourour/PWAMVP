## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (Before Deployment)

#### 1. Preview Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Icons display in browser tab
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully (check DevTools > Application)

#### 2. Test Service Worker
- [ ] Open DevTools > Application > Service Workers
- [ ] Verify service worker is registered and active
- [ ] Check "Offline" in Network tab
- [ ] Refresh page - app should still work
- [ ] Verify offline.html appears if navigating to non-cached page

#### 3. Test Manifest
- [ ] Open DevTools > Application > Manifest
- [ ] Verify all fields are correct:
  - Name: "HOA Management"
  - Theme color: #2563eb (blue)
  - Icons: 4 entries (192, 512, maskable, apple)
  - Display: standalone
- [ ] Click "Add to homescreen" button

#### 4. Test Caching
- [ ] Open DevTools > Application > Cache Storage
- [ ] Verify multiple caches exist:
  - workbox-precache
  - google-fonts-cache
  - images-cache
  - static-resources
- [ ] Check that HTML, CSS, JS files are cached

#### 5. Test IndexedDB
- [ ] Create a test HOA
- [ ] Add some contributions and expenses
- [ ] Open DevTools > Application > IndexedDB

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Choose Hosting Platform
Recommended platforms:
- **Vercel** (easiest for Vite apps)
- **Netlify** (great PWA support)
- **GitHub Pages** (free, requires configuration)
- **Firebase Hosting** (good for apps with backend)
- **Cloudflare Pages** (fast global CDN)

### 2. Deploy Build

#### Option A: Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

#### Option B: Netlify
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### Option C: Firebase
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
- [ ] Test "Add to Home Screen" on real devices
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit on production URL
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Check all icons display correctly
- [ ] Verify service worker updates properly

---

## Troubleshooting

### Icons Not Showing
1. Clear browser cache
2. Uninstall and reinstall PWA
3. Check Network tab for 404 errors on icon files
4. Verify icon paths in manifest.webmanifest

### Service Worker Not Updating
1. Unregister old service worker in DevTools
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check skipWaiting is enabled in vite.config.js

### App Not Installing on iOS
1. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required)
2. Check apple-touch-icon tags in HTML
3. Verify manifest is valid
4. Try Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option

### Offline Mode Not Working
1. Check service worker is active
2. Verify IndexedDB is accessible
3. Check cache storage in DevTools
4. Test network conditions in DevTools

## Performance Optimization Tips

### After Deployment:
1. **Enable Compression**: Ensure your hosting provider uses Gzip/Brotli
2. **CDN**: Use a CDN for faster global access
3. **Cache Headers**: Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement code splitting for large components
5. **Image Optimization**: Compress images further if needed

---

## Monitoring

### Post-Launch:
- Monitor service worker update errors
- Track PWA install rates (if analytics enabled)
- Check for cache storage quota errors
- Monitor offline usage patterns
- Track IndexedDB performance

---
