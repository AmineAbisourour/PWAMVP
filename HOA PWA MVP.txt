Here are some changes that I have in mind Let's plan how to execute The dashboard is not really a dashboard it's a landing page where At a glance the user can have some useful information not all the information but Like a peak of you where he can click and have more information and also a quick actions for the most the actions in the app like Add Contribution or add expense I want you to suggest to me what do you think we should name this page and what information should be displayed in it. And for the danger zone It's glued to the card above it the HOA card make sure that the margins and paddings are consistent and I want a danger zone to be collapsed at first and when clicked then reveal its content

OK let's refine and the overview page I want to get rid of the total contributions total expenses and keep the net balance for the collection rate I want to be able to toggle between monthly collection rate yearly collection rate and the overall collection rate From the oldest transaction To the newest one we should separate between pending contributions and pending expenses we'll keep the outstanding receipts We will keep the ad contribution button and add expense button and wrap them in a card named Quick Actions Get rid of View all button and print report button keep the recent activity and review all link in it. prevents sidebar from scrolling with content

Now let's focus on all transactions page The list view is good with the newest transaction on top we need to extend the bulk actions beyond delete we should also add do it mark as paid and mark the receipts delivered for the contributions By the way in the individual the contribution card like payment pill we should add a another pill for the receipt when it's pending And we need also to add a filtering system That Determine what transactions are showing in the list with the ability to reset the filter to show all transaction again

Always in all transactions page remove and delete all button Keep only the dele that is inside the select menu for the individual transactions Change pending pills Text to become uniform Keep the receipt pills as is and make the payment bill similar to it in the false state payment pending and in the true state payment with a check mark. Make the filter persistent

I want to add a demo mode when the app is loaded for the first time and the user is prompted to create an HOA I want to add a option to load the app in demo mode with some dummy data 

I want to add a splash screen to the app. And I want you to use Intl.NumberFormat And use Moroccan dirham for currency

Do not use the Arabic version of the Moroccan dirham currency I want you to implement a currency selector On the HOA creation and in the HOA settings The Opening balance field empty with a placeholder because now it contains a default 0 which is confusing when the user try to type an opening balance he needs Delete the zero first and then enter his opening amount value And yes go ahead and change across all the app every instance of a currency to consistent By using the new currency format

I want a plan to change the symbol of Moroccan dirham from MAD to DH And I want it to be displayed after the amount And keep the USD and euro unchanged

I'm thinking about adding a country selector in the creation form and in the settings and I want this field infer the currency to use How can we implement this change And also I want you to explain to me the en-US In the currency formatting and can it be changed According country regional Norms

add a country selector after the address when creating a new HOA so when the user choose a country the rest is taken care of, The currency and the original number formatting conventions

A country selector for now Is used to INF the currency and local formatting This is not the only use of it in the future it will used for other things like language and legal systems for specific countries how they manage their HOA so I want the country selector to display only the name of the countries And perhaps the list of supported countries should include all countries in the world and I think it's not logical that this information is in the currency.Js It should be in the database currency.Js should only take care of currency and locals

Do not map countries a set of supported currencies the app should support the currencies from The countries and I've noticed that the creation form and the setting form not identical I want them to be the same I want both forms to be like the creation form and in the layout of fields and everything

Let's tackle the opening amount in the creation form it's fine but it's from the setting form and I don't like the way it is represented in the app like it's like a contribution made by the unit number 0 which is non existent Suggest to me a better way to handle this Unique transaction
